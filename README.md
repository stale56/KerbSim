# KerbSim
A KSP simulation for MATLAB that allows the user to optimize their launch profile.
This simulation makes several assumptions:
  -The rocket is a particle, with the only forces being:
      >Gravity
      >Thrust
      >Drag
  -All heading changes are instantaneous
  -The launch profile is equatorial
  -The drag is acting on a circlular, frontal cross section 
  -Probably a few more
  
I did this to approximate the flight path of a rocket in KSP.



MODS REQUIRED TO USE THE ATTACHED VESSEL:
kOS
RemoteTech ---I will probably make it so you don't need this over the weekend. I just need to remove one part antenna on the vessel.



Have fun! If you have any questions, please send me a PM on reddit /u/stale56
You could probably send me questions or comments over github, I'm not too familiar with github, so I don't actually know.
