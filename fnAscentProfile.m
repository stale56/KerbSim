function [ heading ] = fnAscentProfile( altitude,velocityY)%, turnParam1, turnParam2 )
%fnAscentProfile This doesn't do much yet. it just has a simple profile,
% but it can easily be changed to match whatever you need.




if velocityY < 100
    heading = 90;
else
    heading = 90;
end

    
  



end
